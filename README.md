# Mani Nagendla's Portfolio

This portfolio is built using **TailwindCSS**, **React**, and libraries like **react-icons** and **framer-motion**.  
It showcases my work as an AI/ML Engineer across healthcare, banking, financial services and enterprise analytics — from predictive modelling and LLM fine‑tuning to scalable MLOps and Generative&nbsp;AI systems.  
Hope you like it!
